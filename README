This small library intents to help programmers on their first steps towards library programming in C.
As for myself, I can't say I've got experience in the subject, so this is a help for me as well.

Compile:
$ make

The files lib/libfoo.so, lib/libfoo.a, and src/foomain will be created.

Then you must set LD_LIBRARY_PATH otherwise you'll get an error:
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`pwd`/lib

If you want to compile src/foomain statically linked against libfoo, then you should type:
$ make STATIC=1

There is no need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in this case.

Finally just run foomain:
$ ./src/foomain
